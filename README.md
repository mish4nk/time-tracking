PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many libraries still rely on manual processes to manage seat reservations, resulting in inefficiencies and inconvenience for both staff and patrons. The lack of a digital reservation system leads to several challenges:
• Inefficient Seat Utilization
Without an automated tracking mechanism, seats may remain underutilized, double-booked, or incorrectly assigned.
• Time-Consuming Processes
Both staff and users spend excessive time coordinating seat reservations manually.
• Inaccurate Availability Information
Users often do not have access to real-time seat availability, leading to frustration and unnecessary trips to the library.
• Limited Accessibility
Traditional reservation methods lack flexibility and do not support remote booking or modification of reservations.
PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Library Seat Reservation System is a web-based application designed to digitize and streamline seat reservation operations in libraries. Developed using Java, MySQL, HTML, and Maven within IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, the system provides dedicated features for both users and administrators.
User Features
Seat Availability Check: View real-time availability and choose seats.
Seat Reservation: Reserve seats for chosen hours or time slots.
Check-In / Check-Out: Manage reservations and confirm seat usage.
Admin Features
Reservation Management: View, approve, or modify all reservations.
Seat Maintenance: Cancel or block reservations for damaged or unavailable seats.
User Management: Add and manage user accounts.
